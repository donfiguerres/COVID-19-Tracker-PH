I'm happy to announce that the tracker is now live at a new webserver at
[http://covid-19-tracker-ph.epizy.com/tracker](http://covid-19-tracker-ph.epizy.com/tracker).

# Why migrate?
Github pages was doing fine in hosting my tracker but I noticed that the git
repo at my Windows environment started to take up more and more space for each
update. I realized that I would eventually hit the 1GB limit for GitHub pages
so I decided to migrate the site here at
[http://covid-19-tracker-ph.epizy.com](http://covid-19-tracker-ph.epizy.com).

# Why not register a domain name?
Registering a domain name (although cheap) still costs money and I want to make 
sure somebody else wants to use this site before I even spend money on
registering for a domain name.
