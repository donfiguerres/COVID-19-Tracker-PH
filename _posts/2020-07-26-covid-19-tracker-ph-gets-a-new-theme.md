I'm happy to announce that the COVID-19 Tracker PH site is now using the 
[Chalk Theme](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk).

# Other changes
The live site will now be published from the gh-pages branch since I need to
build the site first locally due to some dependencies not being supported by
Github Pages.
