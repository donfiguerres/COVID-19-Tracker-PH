<h2>Date Proxy</h2>
<p>
Date proxies are shown in the chart below. Date of specimen collection is used by
the DOH in their reporting for cases with no date of onset of illeness. The same
is applied in this tracker. However, in the absence of both the date of onset of
illness and date of specimen collection, the date of reporting is used.
